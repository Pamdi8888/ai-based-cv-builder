## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm (for Angular)
- Python 3.8+
- MySQL Server
- Mistralai API key

### Frontend Setup (Angular)

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-cv-builder.git
   cd ai-cv-builder/frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash

   ```

3. Start the Angular development server:
   ```bash
   ng serve
   ```

### Backend Setup (Flask)

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd ../backend
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up the MySQL database and configure the connection in the `config.py` file.

5. Run database migrations:
   ```bash
   flask db upgrade
   ```

6. Start the Flask development server:
   ```bash
   flask run
   ```

## Usage

## Database Schema

The database schema is designed to store user information, CV templates, and generated CVs. The key tables include:

- **Users**: Stores user profiles and authentication details.
- **Templates**: Stores different CV templates available for selection.
- **CVs**: Stores generated CVs along with associated user data.

SQLAlchemy is used as the ORM to interact with the MySQL database, providing a Pythonic interface for database operations.
